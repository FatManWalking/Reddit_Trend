[Yates] The Saints always have a plan, but their cap situation this offseason will be one to watch. They're currently at ~$276M in cap commitments ($262.5M if Brees retires). Pending FA include DE Trey Hendrickson, S Marcus Williams, QB Jameis Winston, DT Sheldon Rankins, TE Jared Cook.

Eric Bieniemy’s only shot at head coaching job in 2021 could be Eagles
[Tom Brady] I’m sure the twittersphere will only have kind things to say about this gesture. Everybody gets a high five!

[Yates] Urban Meyer's staff will include former Ohio St. & NFL LB Anthony Schlegel, who will be leaving his radio gig in Columbus to be strength & conditioning coach. He worked for Meyer at Ohio State & in 2014 when a fan stormed the field, Schlegel made sure he was going nowhere fast.

[ESPN] The Saints closed out a 4-year span where they won 49 regular season games. That’s the most wins in a 4-year span by a team that failed to reach a Super Bowl
[Pelissero] One possibility for #Chargers offensive coordinator: #Rams OC Kevin O’Connell, who’s very close with new coach Brandon Staley. O’Connell would call plays, but it’s a lateral move on paper, so Sean McVay would have to let him out. If not, Shane Steichen’s a strong internal option.

[Chargers] Got our guy
[CBS Sports] Tom Brady will now have MORE Conference Championship Game appearances (14) than any other two QBs COMBINED*.
[Lee Sharpe] It's hard to believe that Brian Daboll and Eric Bieniemy are still available and the Lions are getting ready to hire Dan Campbell.
What now for Drew Brees and the Saints? NFL experts debate their title window, future at QB
[Mahler] Brees won the Super Bowl in 2009 then spent 11 years chasing another one. Never even got back. They’re damn hard to win. Will be an accomplishment for Wilson to even get back to one, let alone win it
[Vitali] Bruce Arians with some shade as he says Antoine Winfield Jr. should be Defensive Rookie of the Year: “Can’t say enough about him. To me, he's the Defensive Rookie of the Year. Seven and a half sacks isn’t anything to what he’s done.”
[Kleiman] Belichick has missed the playoffs in 7 of 8 seasons with Tom Brady in his career. He has a losing career record without him both overall and just on the Pats. Belichick has 1 total wins in the playoffs without Brady in 8 seasons without him. Brady has 2 without Bill, at age 43.
[Rappaport] With the #Chargers hiring Brandon Staley, and the #Lions now working to finalize a deal with Dan Campbell as their new coach, the only two HC openings left are the Texans and Eagles. In addition, the Falcons can now make official the hire of new GM Terry Fontenot.
[Auman] All three Bucs interceptions tonight off Drew Brees came from 2019 draft picks -- Devin White in first round, Sean Murphy-Bunting in second round and Mike Edwards in third round.
[Kacsmar] Actually fitting we have to revisit 38-10 when Aaron Rodgers melted down in TB. He should have to get over that hurdle to get to this SB. It's the right matchup in NFC with Seattle falling off and Brees looking ready for retirement.
[Auman] Devin White had a great quote about how the Bucs didn't know what their identity was and Bruce Arians said they're "mf-ers" who find a way to win games.
[Breer] One thing that was mentioned to me over the weekend: Brandon Staley is the rare defensive coach who sees the game through a quarterback's eyes. Which is really because he was one, at the Univ. of Dayton. Similar background in that way to Marvin Lewis.
[Auman] Leonard Fournette on 1-2 punch with Ronald Jones today: "I'm telling Ro: Fuck the injury, we need you."
[Schefter] Saints also expected to lose their director of pro scouting, Terry Fontenot, who is expected to be the Falcons’ new general manager, per sources. The two sides still need to work out a deal, but Fontenot is expected to be bound for Atlanta.
With last week's win @ Washington and this week's win @ New Orleans, this is the first time Tom Brady has won two road games in a single postseason.
Since 2015, each team from the NFC South has played in the championship game
Bruce Arians head coached teams are 4-0 vs. the Green Bay Packers
[Gowton] The Saints are losing their Hall of Fame QB, they’re $95M over the cap, and they only have four picks in the 2021 NFL Draft. Hate to see it.
[Kleiman] Who starts for the Saints next season at QB? Hill, Winston, rookie, free-agent signing?
[Kilgore] Notable that Jim Caldwell replacing Tony Dungy in 2009 is still the only time a Black head coach replaced a Black head coach in the NFL.
[ProFootballTalk] I don't like the prospect of a revolving door of offensive coordinators for Justin Herbert. He will get guys head-coaching jobs, and his reward for that will be a lack of continuity.
Of the 19 seasons Tom Brady has played at least 1 full game, he has gone to the championship round in 14 of them.

FWIW, NFL concussion protocol "no return" applies to players with "abnormalities" that are not diagnosed as a concussion. Doesn't seem to define what that would include
Play Breakdown: Henne Completes Crucial 3rd & 4 Pass to Darrel Williams to Help Secure Chiefs' Victory
[Steelers Depot] What is Tom Brady doing here? (video)
In 58 career regular season games, Godwin has 6 drops. In 1.5 playoff games, he also has 6 drops
[Schrager] Good coaches “borrow” from others. Sean Payton did that right there. The Winston TD play was the exact same play design Matt Nagy called last week versus Saints. Cordarelle Patterson to Trubisky to Wims. Smith caught it; Wims did not.
[ESPN] Jameis Winston's Pass TD to Tre'Quan Smith was the first Rec TD with at least 10 yards of separation in the playoffs in the last 5 seasons
[JClarkNBCS] Eagles are still interviewing Josh McDaniels at this hour 🤔”
[Volin] Brees is almost throwing like 2015 Peyton Manning. Great timing and accuracy, absolutely no zip
[Eisen] That was the first career playoff touchdown pass for Jameis Winston and the first playoff touchdown pass thrown for the Saints by someone other than Drew Brees since Aaron Brooks threw two in the Divisional Round of 2000.
[Highlight] The Bears and Saints running the same trick play side by side

[Highlight] TB vs NO - Winston TD pass to Smith
[Capaccio] The last time the Bills played in the AFC Championship Game was in the 1993 season, also against the Chiefs. Here are the starting lineups from that game:
[Darlington] Someone asked if Chad Henne is aware of #hennethingispossible circulating on social media. Henne says he’d only be aware of it if it’s on LinkedIn. “I doubt the hashtag is on LinkedIn,” he added. I have many questions... but let’s just all move on, cool?
[Highlight] Tom Brady throws it to Mike Evans for the game's first touchdown
[Highlight] Drew Brees throws an interception to Sean Murphy-Bunting
[Update] #Saints electric WR/PR Deonte Harris has a neck injury and is questionable to return.
[Yates] The Chiefs will now host their third straight conference championship game, becoming the second team to ever accomplish that. The other? The Eagles from 2002-2004, also coached by Andy Reid. The man is elite.
[Highlight] Lattimore with an insane defensive play to deny Evans
[Trotter] Baker Mayfield, on the Higgins fumble: "There's so many other plays we could've (made)..." #Browns https://t.co/c4lRXDM1Ng
Chadiha: 'My head might explode' if Bieniemy doesn't get HC job in 2021
[Trotter] Baker, on this run coming to an end: “It sucks, to be quite honest. … But trying to find the positive out of it, we're setting a new standard here. … we're going to be back.” #Browns https://t.co/Iy3SsufUJW
[Highlight] Tom Rinaldi’s tribute to Drew Brees and Tom Brady.
[MarkMaske] The Chiefs have no idea if Patrick Mahomes will play next Sunday. Patrick Mahomes has no idea. There is no way for them to know. The decision is not theirs. It's an independent medical decision. So speculation by outsiders about what they think is completely pointless.
[Palmer] #bucs LB Jack Cichy didn’t even go to Tampa Bay’s sideline after getting injured on that punt return. He went with trainers straight to the locker room holding his left arm. A few Saints players went over to him as he went off. Looked … not good.
[Highlight] Another incredible return by Deonte Harris, this one negated by penalty
Head coach outlook bleak for Bieniemy despite wealth of experience, raising questions about hiring practices
[McDowell] Travis Kelce said after the initial hit on Mahomes, Browns players were yelling, "That's what we do. That's what we do."
[Justice] Kevin Stefanski on the challenges: "I should have been better there...that's on me."
[Highlight] Deonte Harris bounces off a gunner and has a 54 yard punt return
[Mack Wilson] Never been a dirty player in my life. I just try my best to play fast and make plays. Don’t try to insult me & keep the threats to yourself. 💯
The Patriots and Chiefs have been in the last 10 AFC Championship Games.
[Taylor]Andy Reid on Patrick Mahomes: "He got hit in the back of the head. He's doing great right now, which is a real positive. We'll see where it goes from here."
[Tapp] Andy Reid on not punting on 4th and 1; "There's no tomorrow, let's go."
[Tapp] Andy Reid says Mahomes "passed all the deal" he had to so far for whatever that's worth
[Withers] Garrett has an oblique injury, Stefanski not sure how much it inhibited him, proud of how he battled.
[Trotter] Myles Garrett said he suffered the oblique injury in the second quarter and that it “definitely got worse,” as the game wore on. But, “it's the playoffs,” he said #Browns
If the Buccaneers reach the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay, it would be the first home-field advantage Super Bowl in history. However, it's the stadium Tom Brady's 5th most familiar with.
[Verderame] The Bills have opened as 1.5-point favorites over the Chiefs for next week
An Underrated Part of the Chiefs’ Brilliant 4th Down Call
[Ruiter] #Browns defense allowed opponents to convert 27 of 32 fourth downs this season, 5-5 in playoffs
[Justice] #Browns Kevin Stefanski on the touchback play: "Rashard Higgins is a warrior. He's battled all season long...I'm never going to doubt that kid's effort...unfortunate play... I'm proud to coach him because he gives it every thing he's got."
[McAfee] Drew Brees will officially be retiring after this season ends says @JayGlazer
[Justice] #Browns Kevin Stefanski "I'm extremely disappointed that we weren't able to get the job done today...I appreciate how our guys battled...it just wasn't enough today."
[Axelrod] Browns' Kevin Stefanski said it's the Browns' rule of thumb to not stretch for the goal line because of the possibility of a touchback. Said he'll never question Rashard Higgins' effort though.
[Thiry] Sean McVay was just asked for clarification on last night's comments regarding who the quarterback is. "Everything is being evaluated," McVay says, emphasizing competition at all spots. "It's all encompassing to our entire roster."
[TheFan] HC Kevin Stefanski on not going for it on 4th and 9 on their final offensive drive: "That was just too long there, that distance. If it was tighter, without a doubt."
[Walder] Tyreek Hill's separation from nearest defender at the time of ball arrival: 5.6 yards
[Clark] Whew. This Deshaun Watson report from Mortensen. "But a source close to Watson told Mortensen that firing Easterby would not resolve the issue, saying that 'Cal McNair would have to fire Cal McNair'"
Texans have had internal conversations about possible trade partners for Deshaun Watson and what their quarterback position would look like in the future without him, per ESPN’s @sarahbarshop.
[Kacsmar] And now a week for the most talked about concussion in NFL history. Can he play a week later? That's going to be a close call. 10 years ago Mahomes is a lock to play. But now? It's different.
[Grove] Browns never quit. Incredible fight amongst an incredible amount of adversity. What a year. #Browns

[Surrender Index] CLE decided to punt to KC from the CLE 32 on 4th & 9 with 4:19 remaining in the 4th while losing 17 to 22. With a Surrender Index of 7.46, this punt ranks at the 92nd percentile of cowardly punts of the 2020 season, and the 90th percentile of all punts since 2009.

[Chiefs Official Twitter] Dirty Dan loves making plays in the playoffs 😏
[Update] Tyrann Mathieu being signed as a free agent by the Chiefs in 2019 is one of the best free agent signings in Kansas City franchise history. Anchor of the defense and always comes up big.
[Highlight] Tyronn Mathieu picks off Baker Mayfield
Evaluating the Jamal Adams Trade
[Rosenthal] This is a reminder that ‘shortening the game” often results in losing faster. Browns had 3 possessions and now have less time to make a comeback.
[Statsinfo] Patrick Mahomes has 23 straight wins when leading at the half, trailing only Jared Goff.
[Brad_Gagnon] When NFL competition committee chairman Rich McKay explained a couple years ago why that rule wasn't changed, he said, “There were eight instances this year, three the year before and three the year before that. We did not believe it merited a proposal." Idiotic justification.
[NFL Update] Bill Belichick has a policy that players aren’t allowed to extend the football at the pylon while falling across the goal line. The risk outweighs the reward.
[Isola] So the helmet to helmet hit causes the fumble and that’s ok?
[Highlight] CLE vs KC - Cleveland's drive ends with a touchback

[Highlight] Mecole Hardman is a blur as he takes it 41 yards!
[Browns] Injury Update: Jedrick Wills Jr. is questionable to return (ankle)
[Jeremiah] If Watson became available via trade, the Jets should call. You could trade 2nd pick this year (they still have 23rd pick), 1st in 2022 (They have 2) & 1st in 2023. That’s 3 first round picks. They could pickup extra pick/picks if they traded Sam. (My gift to sports radio)
[Cimini] The Jets absolutely should explore a Watson trade, but his no-trade clause allows him to pick his destination. They still need a lot of pieces.
[Nick Wagoner] ust my opinion but if Deshaun Watson is gonna hit the button to force his way out of Houston, he might as well go all the way with it and choose his destination via his no trade clause. Can set himself up for maximum individual and team success.
Aaron Rodgers now has the most NFC Championship game appearances in franchise history (5). He is tied for second with Donovan McNabb and Favre with second most all time and only trails Montana and Staubach (6).
[Highlight] Patrick Mahomes runs it in for the Chiefs' first touchdown of the day
[Joe Haden] Chiefs Vs Browns! This is wild! I’m honestly Happy for the browns fans! They Treated me like Gold in CLeveland. Can’t say the same about management...
[Fowler] Despite lack of momentum with Eric Bieniemy for a head coaching job thus far, he's firmly in the mix in Houston, as GM Nick Caserio has done thorough homework on the Chiefs OC, per sources. Not an empty interview request by any stretch. Bieniemy waiting post-playoffs to talk.
[@SportsCenter] Lamar Jackson took the time to sign autographs for a group of Bills and Ravens fans after the playoff game.
In retrospect just how big of an issue was BOB to the Texans?
Game Thread: Cleveland Browns (11-5) at Kansas City Chiefs (14-2)

Is there a salary advantage for Texas and Florida teams because they have no income tax?
[Schefter] One league source connected to the Texans' HC situation said Saturday: "It's gone from the least desirable head coaching job (opening) to the most undesirable head coaching job in the NFL. That's a fact. That's how that job is now looked at by everybody."
From 2013: Given that Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning will all be over the age of 40 in less than five years, which young QB's do you see becoming elite passers by the 2018 season?
[John-Michael Holahan] The @BuffaloBills are one (Hail Murray) away from a 12-game winning streak.
[Joe Kipp] “#Rams CB Jalen Ramsey allowed a passer rating of 144.4 when targeted as the nearest defender against the #Packers, according to @NextGenStats”
[Palmer] Tom Brady has completed nearly twice as many deep passes (35) as Drew Brees has attempted (19) this season. Since Week 12, Brady is leading the NFL in completions (17), pass yards (594), and pass TD (7) on deep passes.

[Schefter] Chiefs’ RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who missed practice time this week with ankle and hip injuries, and is listed as questionable for today, will not play against the Browns, per source. CEH is very close to returning and if KC wins today, should be back for AFC Championship Game.
[Rotoworld] Eagles telling HC candidates Wentz "is fixable"
Today in 1999: The perfect kicker picks the worst time to miss
[Crocker] I have a take on Jared Goff and Jimmy Garoppolo. If you want to win a SuperBowl with either one of those guys, everything has to be PERFECT! We’ve seen them both win a bunch of games. Both play in a SuperBowl. Both lose a SuperBowl the same way and it comes down to they are not playmakers.
Today is tied for the latest date the Browns have ever played a game. The only other time? Jan. 17, 1988. The Fumble.

Booth Review (Divisional Round, Saturday games)
[Rapoport] The #Bucs will decide on RB Ronald Jones (quad/finger) when they arrive at the stadium, but he participated in the walk-through on Saturday which is a sign he’s got a good shot to play. Officially, he’s listed as questionable vs the #Saints.
[OC] [Highlight] Today is WR Derrick Mason’s 47th birthday. Mason played 15 years in the NFL from 1997-2011, making two Pro Bowls and finishing with 943 receptions for 12,061 yards. To celebrate, here’s every TD that Mason scored during his eight seasons with the Titans

[Wes Hodkiewicz] So, the #Packers became the first team in NFL playoff history to register 475-plus yards of total offense and 175-plus rushing yards with zero sacks allowed and zero turnovers in a game.
Former players (nfl/college) or employees: What is said from defensive players to make an offensive player retaliate mid game?
[Pelissero] The #Chargers will interview #Rams DC Brandon Staley a second time today -- in-person -- for their head coaching job, per sources. The #Texans also plan to speak with Staley today, and the #Eagles plan to fly him in Monday. But L.A., fittingly, gets the first shot.
[Rapoport]The #Saints are not likely to have QB Taysom Hill (knee) or RB Latavius Murray (quadricep) vs the #Bucs, per me and @SlaterNFL. Both practiced only on Friday and were listed as questionable.
[NFL Update] When Stefon Diggs was traded to the #Bills, the #1 question was how would he gel with Josh Allen. When Matt LaFleur was hired by the #Packers, the #1 question was how would he gel with Aaron Rodgers. It worked. And then some. Both teams are one game away from the Super Bowl.
Ravens Go Stale in Another Disappointing Playoff Exit
Who will be the best rookie RB in 3 years in your opinion? I got either Taylor or Akers
[TDISportsClips] January 17, 1999: The Falcons upset the Vikings 30-27 in Overtime in the NFC Championship Game. Vikings Kicker Gary Anderson, who hadn’t missed a FG in two years, missed a 38-yarder with two minutes left in the 4th Quarter that would have sealed the game.

[Schefter] Next Sunday will be Aaron Rodgers’ first NFC Championship game at Lambeau Field - vs. either Tom Brady or Drew Brees.
Game Thread: Baltimore Ravens (11-5) at Buffalo Bills (13-3)
[Walder] Jaire Alexander played 31 coverage snaps and was the nearest defender on 3 targets per Next Gen Stats. The Rams had -3 yards on 1 reception when Alexander was nearest defender in the game.
[Volin] Aaron Donald played 39 of 72 snaps tonight and finished with 1 tackle and 1 pressure. He obviously wasn't himself
With the Ravens/Bills divisional round playoff game in Buffalo starting at 8:15 PM ET, this will be the first time the Bills host a playoff game that starts later than 2 PM ET.
[Demovsky] From ELIAS: The Packers finished with 484 total yards on offense. That's the most against a No. 1 defense (in terms of yards per game) in a playoff game since the merger.
[Highlight] Aaron Donald is taking the loss hard
With the Packers win today, next week’s NFC Championship will feature the first ever playoff game between Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees or Tom Brady.
[Yates] Against the NFL’s #1 defense, the Packers just scored 32 points and had 484 total yards, 94 more than LA had allowed in any game. They scored on each of their first five drives. They did not turn the football over. They did not allow a sack. They punted twice. Surgical.
[Update] Aaron Rodgers is going to his fifth NFC Championship Game. Next Sunday will be his first at Lambeau Field.
Post Game Thread: Los Angeles Rams (10-6) at Green Bay Packers (13-3)
[Breer] Packers coach Matt LaFleur is now 28-7 with two NFC North titles and two trips to the NFC Championship Game. Not a bad hire.

[David Samson] "If I'm running the Dolphins, I'm having an immediate meeting with GM & coach to identify who said this, I'm calling every one of them. 'Am I missing something? Do you have a problem with Tua? Because you bring that here. You don't air dirty laundry to the Miami Herald"
[Green] The Jaguars last game was coached by Doug Marrone with Mike Glennon at quarterback. The Jaguars next game will be coached by Urban Meyer with Trevor Lawrence at quarterback......Oh Yeah Man
[Lombardi] - Back in 2004, while on Central Michigan's staff, Robert Saleh was roommates in a small apartment with Matt LaFleur, now Green Bay's coach. 16 years later, Saleh is an NFL head coach and he'll be hiring LaFleur's younger brother, Mike, to be his offensive coordinator
[Highlight] Schefter says that he expects Darnold to be the Jets starting QB next season
[Rosenfels] Some coaches and players brought to Houston by Gary Kubiak. Shanahan LeFleur Robert Saleh Mike McDaniel Mike Sherman Troy Calhoun (Air Force HC since 2007) John Benton (49ers OL) Demeco Ryans (LBer coach 49ers) Anthony Weaver (DC Texans) Alex Gibbs (godfather of outside zone)
[Breer] - Text from 49ers GM John Lynch on Robert Saleh: "Robert's earned this opportunity. He's smart, a tremendously gifted leader and ready for this challenge. We'll miss him dearly but he's left us better and we'll be proud of all that he'll accomplish. The Jets are very fortunate."
[Brugler] Mike LaFleur + Zach Wilson would be a VERY interesting match. #Jets
[Hughes] Would expect Demeco Ryans to join as DC with LaFleur as OC.

[Warikoo] Robert Saleh would be the second Arab-American to be head coach of the New York Jets. Rich Kotite was head coach of the Jets in mid 1990s. Both are of Lebanese descent.
[NFL Update] The #49ers will receive a third round compensatory pick in each of the next two drafts for losing Saleh.
[Rapoport] With Robert Saleh gone, expect the #49ers to promote LBs coach DeMeco Ryans as their new defensive coordinator, source said. An impressive young coach.
[Schefter] New Jets’ HC Robert Saleh is expected to take 49ers passing game coordinator Mike LaFleur as his offensive coordinator, per sources.
[NFL Update] The hiring of Robert Saleh has less to do with getting an offensive or defensive mind. It's about finding a leader. Someone who can be a leader of men. The #Dolphins did just that in 2019 & they identified Brian Flores. #Jets are getting that with Saleh. Huge get for Joe Douglas.
Ranking the 4 games this Divisional weekend, rank the upsets from most likely to near impossible in your own opinion.
[Anderson] A source who was a candidate for the job told me the #Jets informed them they are hiring Robert Saleh.
[Schefter] Panthers officially reached agreement tonight on a five-year deal with former Seahawks VP Scott Fitterer as their GM. “We went through a thorough process and it was a great final four,” said Panthers’ owner David Tepper. “We thought Scott was the best fit for the organization.”

[Smith] I feel like people don't actually grasp how good a coach Urban Meyer is. Yes, he usually had the more talented team at Florida and Ohio State. But even coaches with loads of talent don't win as much as he did. And he beat lots of more talented teams at Bowling Green and Utah.
Jaire Alexander has been putting up similar stats to Jalen Ramsey.

Ezekiel Elliott is on the Cowboys sideline stretching out his right leg. He has been battling a calf injury in recent weeks and is playing at less than 100%.
Most of the people around the league believe that the 49ers are done with QB Jimmy Garoppolo [OUT for Week 17], according to @mortreport San Francisco made Garoppolo the highest paid QB in league history after he made only 7 career starts in 2018. Already seems to be over.
Worst part of the play where Mike Evans got injured? Tom Brady also seemed to hit his hand on a helmet after the throw and dealing with an hand problem now. So we had record set by Evans->Dropped TD by Evans->Injury to Evans->Possible injury to Brady.
